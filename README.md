# control servo and stepper motors using ATMEGA16
 A stepper motor is a type of brushless DC motor that can rotate in discrete steps by changing the magnetic field of its stator coils. Unlike a conventional DC motor, a stepper motor does not need a position sensor or a feedback loop to control its motion. Instead, it relies on an external controller that sends a sequence of pulses to switch the current direction in the coils and move the rotor to a desired position.  There are two main types of stepper motors: unipolar and bipolar. The difference between them lies in the number of wires and the way the coils are connected.
